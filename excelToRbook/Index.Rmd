Hello! Welcome to Tech Trainings - From Excel to R. We're here to enhance the productivity of your business by ditching Excel and employing R. Our tutorials are focused and designed for employees currently working. R is currently ranked as the [7th most popular language in the world](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) - and with good reason! We'll dive into why R is ranked so high and how it can benefit you and your business. 

This intro to R course is designed to teach R to businesses and employees who frequently use Excel for day-to-day operations. Few businesses around the world leverage the amazing features of R and we're here to teach these skills. To put it bluntly, R saves you and your employees a ton of time. We've seen users cut down daily 2-3 *hour* tasks in Excel into 2-3 *minutes* after some basic introduction to R. In this case, R saved this individual employee 750 hours per year - allowing employee time to be used towards more creative problem-solving endeavors. 

This is a concentrated, fast-paced course designed to improve business efficiency, cut down tedious tasks, and increase the creative time spent by employees. Most online R tutorials are far too broad and can leave a student frustrated at the vast abilities of R. R can be used to accomplish a great deal, but instead of showing off what R can do, we discuss and teach select skills that can be used to improve day-to-day business efficiency immediately. We're not here to waste your time and overwhelm our students like other R workshops.

This concentrated course follows a design of specific problem solving. We present common business practices often handled using Excel and show an employee can use R to accomplish the same task at a faster pace. The workshop is split into 5 days with assignments due each day. This course was developed by James Simkins who has taught multiple programming courses at the University of Delaware.
