# US Work Visas - Part 2

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/teamwork_visa.jpg")  
```

In this tutorial, we'll be exploring the H1-B Visa. The H-1B is a visa in the United States which allows U.S. employers to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. We'll examine what kind of foreign workers are most often employed. 

**Goals of this tutorial**
* Introduce advanced plotting routines
* Further explore the H1-B visa dataset
* Focus on spatial distribution of applications
* Practice `dplyr` and `tibble`
 
**Datasets used**
* `h1bvisa_part1.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part2.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part3.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part4.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part5.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part6.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part7.csv`


## Revisiting the H1-B Visa Dataset

We're already familiar with this dataset from last week, so let's dive right in from where we left off.

```{r}
# first let's load in the packages we need
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(DT)
library(tidyr)
library(corrplot)
library(leaflet)
library(lubridate)
library(cowplot)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)

# set the path 
csv_path = "datasets/visa_data/"

# list all files within that path 
csv_list = list.files(path=csv_path, full.names = TRUE)

csv_list

# Read all csv files in the folder and create a list of dataframes
ldf <- lapply(csv_list , read.csv)

# Combine each dataframe in the list into a single dataframe
visa_df <- do.call("rbind", ldf)


# str_split or string split is a great function to use. It breaks up a string based on a character. In this case we want to split our string into a list of cities and states which are split by a comma
worksites = str_split(visa_df$WORKSITE, ",", simplify = TRUE)
head(worksites)

# grab the second column which is just the states
states = worksites[,2]
head(states)

# Now we can use the trimws() function to trim the whitespace and get rid of the leading spaces
states = trimws(states)
# now add it to the dataframe
visa_df$states <- states
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
datatable(head(visa_df,10), style="default", class="table-condensed", options = list(dom = 'tp',scrollX = TRUE))
```

## Full Time Positions

What percentage is full time vs part time? 

```{r}
# filter the data where there is data under FULL_TIME_POSITION (i.e. get rid of values that are NA)
pos_df = filter(.data = visa_df, !is.na(FULL_TIME_POSITION))
# group the data by the FULL_TIME_POSITION
pos_df = group_by(.data=pos_df, FULL_TIME_POSITION)
# summarize the data based on the total number of recrods 
pos_df = summarise(.data = pos_df,total_records = length(lat))

# what does pos_df look like
pos_df
```

Alright, we have the total number of records for both Full time and Part Time position. What's the percentage breakdown between the two? To answer this specific question, a pie chart might be useful. Luckily, a package called `plotrix` has a function called `pie3D` which can be used to accomplish this task.

```{r}
library(plotrix)

# create a list of our unique labels - Part time is first because it's the first row in pos_df (aka where the answer to full time position is N)
lbls = c("Part time","Full time")

# calculte the perdentage
pcts = round(pos_df$total_records / sum(pos_df$total_records) * 100)

# note that we use paste here and not paste0, remember that the 0 means 0 spaces between
lbls = paste(lbls, pcts)

lbls

# now let's add a % sign in
lbls = paste(lbls,"%", sep="")

lbls

# create a list of the colors we want here 
cols = c("aquamarine3", "indianred")

pie3D(x=pos_df$total_records, labels=lbls, col = cols, explode=0, main = "H1-B Visa Positions type")
```

There are more part time positions rather than fulltime for this dataset. `pie3D` can be a useful, quick way to create a piechart.

## Applications by State

**How does the number of total applications vary by state? What's a good way to visualize this?**

We can use `dplyr` to separate out the total applications by state. We'll have to use our `states` variable that we included with teh dataset above. 

```{r}
# filter out the NA data
state_df = filter(.data = visa_df, !is.na(states))

# group the dataframe by states
state_df = group_by(.data = state_df, states)

# create a summary per state by counting the total number of cases for each state
state_df = summarise(.data = state_df, total_records = length(CASE_STATUS))

# Normalize the data by dividing by 1000
state_df$total_records <- state_df$total_records/1000

#remember we can change the name of our columns if we want to
colnames(state_df) <- c("state","value")

# use the treemap function from the treemap package to create the plot
library(treemap)
treemap(state_df, 
        index=c("state"), 
        type="value",
        vSize = "value",  
        vColor="value",
        palette = "RdBu",  
        title="H1-B Visa Applications per State(thousands)", 
        fontsize.title = 14 
    )
```

`treemap`s are great for visualizing data like this. Both the color and the total amount of space taken up in the image are correlated to the total amount of applications by state. Notice that the arguments for the `treemap` are a little different than `ggplot2`. `treemap` is not part of tidyverse, but still can be used with any data frame (as with most things in R).


## Prevailing Wage by Location

Let's investigate another type of plot that R is capable of creating - a leaflet interactive plot. We'll dive into this but first we'll need to manipulate the data. Remember the lat/lon rounding we did? Let's do that again only let's round it down to 1/1000th decimal place.

```{r}
visa_df$lat = round(visa_df$lat,3)
visa_df$lon = round(visa_df$lon,3)
```

Now let's filter our dataset, group it by `lat` and `lon`, and then take the mean of the `PREVAILING WAGE` variable.
```{r}
# filter out the NA values of the `lat` variable
wage_df = filter(.data = visa_df, !is.na(lat))

# filter out the NA values of the `lon` variable
wage_df = filter(.data = wage_df, !is.na(lon))

# filter for cases where the CASE_STATUS is CERTIFIED
wage_df = filter(.data = wage_df, CASE_STATUS == "CERTIFIED")

# group by the lat AND lons (for times when the same company (aka same lat/lon) has multiple applications)
wage_df = group_by(.data = wage_df, lat,lon)

# summarize the data by taking the average PREVAILING WAGE
wage_df = summarise(.data = wage_df, avg = mean(PREVAILING_WAGE))

# create the bins in which our color palette will have corresponding values 
bins <- c(min(wage_df$avg),50000, 100000, 150000, 200000 ,max(wage_df$avg))

# create a custom color palette using pre-exisitng paletes and then coloring in the values based on the bins above
# note that we use the premade color palette "RdYlGn" in R. 
pal <- colorBin("RdYlGn", domain = wage_df$avg, bins = bins)

# using leaflet which involves PIPING
leaflet(data = wage_df) %>%
  addTiles() %>% setView(-99, 35, zoom = 4) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lat=wage_df$lat, lng=wage_df$lon, radius=sqrt(wage_df$avg)/20, color = ~pal(wage_df$avg), weight=1.5, opacity=0.8,
    popup= paste("Average Wage $", round(wage_df$avg/1000), "k")
    )

```

There we have it, a beautiful and interactive map showing average wage for by location. `leaflet` is a powerful tool to visualize spatial data. The key here with `leaflet` is that with `ggplot` we can use the `+` sign to add additional arguments/functionality to a plot. With `leaflet`, we need to use the pipe operator - `%>%`. Remember, the pipe operator can be though of as *sending* or *passing* along information. In this case we create a `leaflet` instance with `leaflet(data=wage_df)`. We pipe that over to the `leaflet` function `addTiles()`. This creates the map. Then we set the view of the image as `setView` and then pipe that to the `leaflet` function as `addCircleMarkers`. This is the most advanced function with the `leaflet` package as we can add in a ton of functionality. An important note here is that for the `color` argument, we are using our pre-made color palette `pal`. 

## Recap

* Although we've spent a good bit of time with the most popular plotting package (`ggplot2`), there are other plotting packages in R that can be very useful
* The `treemap` package is useful for showing concentrations and distributions of a particular variable
* `leaflet` is a powerful interactive plotting package that's great for spatial maps
* R has many premade color palettes that are useful - [more can be found here](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)

## Assignment

1) What state is offering the highest average wage? What about the lowest? Create a `treemap` of the average prevailing wage by state. 

2) Where are the applications primarily coming from? Create a `leaflet` plot of the applications by location. First, round the lat/lon values to the 2nd decimal place. Then, plot your leaflet!

You'll want your resulting plots to look something like...

```{r, echo = FALSE}
visa_df %>% filter(!is.na(PREVAILING_WAGE)) %>% filter(PREVAILING_WAGE>0) %>% 
  filter(CASE_STATUS == "CERTIFIED") %>%
  group_by(states) %>% summarise(avg = mean(PREVAILING_WAGE)) %>% ungroup() -> dws

dws$avg <- dws$avg/1000
colnames(dws) <- c("region","value")
 treemap(dws, 
        index=c("region"), 
        type="value",
        vSize = "value",  
        vColor="value",
        palette = "RdBu",  
        title="Average prevailing wage per state", 
        title.legend="Annual wage (thousands USD)",
        fontsize.title = 14 
    )

visa_df %>% filter(!is.na(lat)) %>% filter(!is.na(lon)) %>% group_by(lat,lon) %>%
  summarise(nr = length(lat)) %>% ungroup() -> dl

colnames(dl) <- c("lat","lon","value")
bins <- c(max(dl$value),150000,100000,50000,min(dl$value))
pal <- colorBin("RdYlGn", domain = dl$value, bins = bins)

leaflet(data = dl) %>%
  addTiles() %>% setView(-99, 35, zoom = 4) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lat=dl$lat, lng=dl$lon, radius=sqrt(dl$value)/10, color = ~pal(dl$value), weight=1.5, opacity=0.8,
    popup= paste("<br><strong>Applications: </strong>", dl$value
    ))
```
