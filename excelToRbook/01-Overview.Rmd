## What is R?

R is an open-source (aka free) programming language. It was initially created to statistical operations in the 1990s but has since expanded greatly and can now be used to accomplish almost any data related task. Using R involves writing a script. A script is just an R document that performs some sort of analysis / operation / image creation. Writing code and generating an R script is done completely via typing as opposed to pointing and clicking. In this workshop we'll learn how to write an R script and use it to perform data analysis. 


The purpose of this workshop is to teach working professionals how to use R for tasks they'd normally use Excel for. Excel is a powerful tool and is great for a variety of uses, but when it comes to crunching data, R will greatly improve the speed at which these tasks can be done. Furthermore, with R, mundane & tedious tasks can be automated. When you write a script in R for a recurring task such as calculating a monthly budget, all one needs to do each month is provide the routine with a new dataset to crunch the numbers. Below are examples of why we use R. 

## Reasons to love R
| Attribute | Reason |
|----|----------|
| Speed | Spreadsheets that take 1 hour to calculate in Excel take less than a second in R |
| Capacity | Excel can handle thousands of records, R can handle millions |
| Risk Reduction | Excel requires process notes, manual steps, copy/paste values, fill down, etc. After writing a single R script, R is auditable reproducible within milliseconds - without any alterations to your original data|
| Visualizations | R is capable to create high quality visualizations and also has the capacity to create interactive visualizations that can easiliy be shared. Plots or images can easily be exported to PNG, JPEG, or even web-based interactive dashboards that can be hosted on a webpage |
| Collaboration | R script sharing is much safer than in Excel. Data output can be shared without the concern of a colleague editing the file output. RStudio connect or Github are also popular free track all changes that take place between R script files.|
| Price | R is completely free! Yes...every bit of it!  |


## Guiding Principles

1. Comment, comment, comment. Once you become comfortable coding in R, you'll be able to churn out new R scripts at a faster rate. It's very important that you comment on what you're doing at each step in the script so if you need to look back on something you wrote you can reference what you were doing there. A comment in R is declared using the pound symbol (#). 

2. Keep raw data raw. An advantage of R is being able to read in an original spreadsheet and output a new spreadsheet as a separate file. Don't overwrite the input file so in the event you make a mistake in your R routine, you can just edit the R script and re-run to edit/overwrite the output file or image. 

3. When in doubt, Google your R question - look for StackOverflow links. StackOverflow is a web-forum where programmers can post questions for help. This is an incredible tool that I still use daily for things I've forgotten. There are other helpful forums out there - StackOverflow is the most popular. 

4. Spaces in variable/file names are BAD. Let's get into the habit of using underscores '_' or dashes '-' or periods '.' to separate words instead of spaces. From the computers side of variable name storage, it's much safe to declare a variable name such as **data_file** as opposed to **data file**
