```

In this tutorial, we'll be exploring the H1-B Visa. The H-1B is a visa in the United States which allows U.S. employers to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. We'll examine what kind of foreign workers are most often employed. 

**Goals of this tutorial**
* Introduce the `for` loop and `paste0`
* Use R to load in big data
* Practice using `dplyr` and `tibble` on the visa dataset
* Investigate H1-B visa trends
 
**Datasets used**
* `h1bvisa_part1.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part2.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part3.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part4.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part5.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part6.csv`
* `h1bvisa_part7.csv`


## The For Loop - Quick Introduction

For loops & conditional statements are a key skill in programming. They allow you to process through large datasets or multiple datasets thus minimizing the amount of manual work you need to do. The basic for loop looks like this...

```{r}
# Generate sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 using the seq() function (seq for sequence)
numbersList = seq(from=1,to=10,by=1)
# Multiply each number in the numbersList by 8 and print the result
for (i in numbersList){
  temNumber = i * 8
  print(temNumber)
}
```

Notice the general structure of R for loops. 'for' signals to R you're beginning a for loop, which requires the general structure to look like:

`for (numbers/values to loop through){`
  `condition for the looping using the numbers/values above`
`}`

Yes, you must have these parentheses and curly brackets present and surrounding the appropriate code. If you forget a parentheses or curly bracket you'll have errors pop up...this happens to me all the time still. 

While these must be present, R doesn't care where they are in your code (****which is very unique amongst programming languages). For example, notice how this ugly code is different but still runs...

```{r}
# Generate sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 using the seq() function (seq for sequence)
numbersList = seq(from=1,to=10,by=1)
# Multiply each number in the numbersList by 8 and print the result
for (        i in numbersList       
      ){
  temNumber = i * 8
  print(temNumber)
        }
```


The general structure is still: for(condition){do something}. If statements are set up the same way

```{r}
# Generate sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 using the seq() function (seq for sequence)
numbersList = seq(from=1,to=10,by=1)
# Multiply each number in the numbersList by 8 and print the result
for (i in numbersList){
  if (i==4){
    temNumber = i * 8
    print(temNumber)
  }
}
```

This is referred to as a 'nested loop', because there is a conditional statement within another one. Key takeaway here: in programming languages, '=' is an assignment (i.e. x = 4), whereas '==' is an equality test (i == 4). To put this loop in layman's terms: for i in numbersList, if i is equal to 4, multiply i by 8 and then print temNumber. 

We can also have nested for loops. 

```{r}
# Generate sequence of numbers from 1 to 3 this time using the seq() function (seq for sequence)
numbersList = seq(from=1,to=3,by=1)
lettersList = list("A", "B", "C")

for (num in numbersList){
  for (let in lettersList){
    print(c(num,let))
  }
}
```

You can name the object within the list whatever you want (i, j, num, let, etc.). Reminder, c() is the concatenate functin that combines values into a vector or list. The order doesn't matter in this for loop...

```{r}
# Generate sequence of numbers from 1 to 3 this time using the seq() function (seq for sequence)
numbersList = seq(from=1,to=3,by=1)
lettersList = list("A", "B", "C")

for (let in lettersList){
  for (num in numbersList){
    print(c(num,let))
  }
}
```

But it does in this one...

```{r}
# Generate sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 using the seq() function (seq for sequence)
numbersList = seq(from=1,to=10,by=1)
# Multiply each number in the numbersList by 8 and print the result
if (i==4){
  for (i in numbersList){
    temNumber = i * 8
    print(temNumber)
  }
}
```

Here's one more example for multi conditional statement with an else...

```{r}
# Generate sequence of numbers from 1 to 3 this time using the seq() function (seq for sequence)
numbersList = seq(from=1,to=3,by=1)
lettersList = list("A", "B", "C")

for (num in numbersList){
  for (let in lettersList){
    if (num == 3 && let == "B"){
      print(c(num,let))
    } else{
      print("Not what we want")
    }
  }
}
```

&& means "and" ... || means "or"...these are useful in multi conditional statements. The 'else' statement is an appendage of the 'if' statement. It basically means if num == 3 and let == B is false, print "not what we want". Notice that the 'else' statement is outside of the 'if' statement but immediately after it. 

## `paste()` and `paste0()` - Quick Introduction

`paste()` `paste0()` are some of the most commonly used functions in R. These allow you concatenate a series of strings together into 1. This is very handy when it comes ot writing filepaths to read/write data files. 


``` {r, warning=FALSE}
# Paste Example 1 - default sep (aka separation) is space
paste("file", "number", "32")

# Paste Example 2 - set sep to "_"
paste("file", "number", "32", sep = "_")

# Paste0 Example 1 - 0 for 0 separating characters
paste0("file", "number", "32")

# Notice that paste() is limiting because the separating character is not always present between
# each string you're concatenating
# Let's use paste0 here
fileList <- c('filename1', 'filename2', 'filename3', 'filename4')
dateFolder <- c('0813', '0814', '0815', '0816')
homeDir <- "~/Documents/"
pathList <- list()

for (i in 1:length(fileList)){
  print(i)
  tempString <- paste0(homeDir, dateFolder[i], '/', fileList[i])
  pathList[i] <- tempString
}

pathList

pathList[[1]]

```


## Exploring the Data

### Reading in multiple datasets and combining them
```{r}
# first let's load in the packages we need
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(DT)
library(tidyr)
library(corrplot)
library(leaflet)
library(lubridate)
library(cowplot)
```

For this tutorial, we have 7 separate CSV files. Let's show a few different ways to load all 7 and merge them together into a single `data.frame` instance. The first way we'll show loading in multiple datasets is the `for` loop!

```{r}
# define our path
path = "datasets/visa_data/"

# first, create a sequence of numbers 1:7
nseq = seq(1,7)
csv_list = list()

# create a list of all the filenames
for (n in nseq){
  csv_list[n] = paste0('h1bvisa_part', n, '.csv')
}

# now using that list above, let's read in all files and then append them to the original dataframe
for (c in 1:length(csv_list)){
  if (c == 1){
    visa_df = read.csv(paste0(path, csv_list[c]))
  } else {
    nextPart = read.csv(paste0(path, csv_list[c]))
    visa_df = rbind(visa_df, nextPart)
  }
}

# check out the class
class(visa_df)
# check out the dimensions
dim(visa_df)
# check out the dimensions if our `nextPart` that's being overwritten
dim(nextPart)
```


Let's break down this code. First we declare our list of CSV names and the Path that they're located at. Then, we begin the for loop. We state that for `c` in 1 to the `length` of the `csv_list` (i.e. - 1 to 3), do what's in the loop. Inside the loop, our first clause states that `if c==1` we want to create a `data.frame` called `visa_df`. We use our `read.csv()` function and direct that function to the `path` and `filename` of our csv. If it's the 2nd or 3rd iteration of the loop, the `visa_df` is already created and thus we want to append our additional data to this `data.frame`. We do this by loading in the CSV files to our temporary `nextPart` variable. Once `nextPart` is loaded, we then use the `rbind()` function which stands for **row bind**. We bind together the two dataframes (`visa_df` and `nextPart`) by their *rows*. In other words, we just add in the additional data as additional rows since the datasets share the same column names. The end product is our single dataframe that we created from 3 separate csv files.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
datatable(head(visa_df,10), style="default", class="table-condensed", options = list(dom = 'tp',scrollX = TRUE))
```

As with many things in R, there are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Here's a more advanced (yet simpler) way to read in and merge these files.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# set the path 
csv_path = "datasets/visa_data/"

# list all files within that path 
csv_list = list.files(path=csv_path, full.names = TRUE)

csv_list

# Read all csv files in the folder and create a list of dataframes
ldf <- lapply(csv_list , read.csv)

# Combine each dataframe in the list into a single dataframe
visa_df <- do.call("rbind", ldf)
```

In this more advanced example, we load in the packages that contain the following functions (this is already done above, but I'm doing it again to show you where these functions come from). After setting the `csv_path`, we then use the function `list.files()` which lists all files within a give path. In our case, all of our Visa CSV data is located within `/datasets/visa_data`. Then we use the `lapply` function which is a function useful for performing operations on list objects and returns a list object of same length of original set. We give `lapply` a list (`csv_list`) and a function (`read.csv`) to do on that list. This creates a larger list of the output of `read_csv` from our `csv_list`. Finally, we create our `visa_df` via the `do.call` function (which behaves very similar to `lapply`). The `do.call` function is given a function (`rbind`) and then a list to perform that function on (`ldf`). `lapply` and `do.call` are similar but here's the difference: 

* lapply() applies a given function for each element in a list,so there will be several function calls.
* do.call() applies a given function to the list as a whole,so there is only one function call.

Once again, here's our `visa_df`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
datatable(head(visa_df,10), style="default", class="table-condensed", options = list(dom = 'tp',scrollX = TRUE))
```

Now that we have our dataset, let's explore it!

### Manipulating our Data Frame

* X1,X2,X - not named column, it is the id of the row;
* CASE_STATUS - status of the application;
* EMPLOYER_NAME - the name of the employer as registered in the H-1B Visa application;
* SOC_NAME - the occupation code for the employment;
* JOB_TITLE - the job title for the employment;
* FULL_TIME_POSITION - whether the application is for a full-time position of for a part-time position;
* PREVAILING_WAGE - the most frequent wage for the corresponding role as filled in the Visa application;
* YEAR - the application year;
* WORKSITE - the address of the employer worksite;
* lon - longitude of the employer worksite;
* lat - latitude of the employer worksite;

First, let's get rid of columns we don't need like `X.2`, `X.1`, and `X`.

```{r}
visa_df$X.2 = NULL
visa_df$X.1 = NULL
visa_df$X = NULL
```

Next, we notice that the `WORKSITE` variable contains a City, State type string. Let's break this out and create a new column with just states.

```{r}
library(stringr)
# str_split or string split is a great function to use. It breaks up a string based on a character. In this case we want to split our string into a list of cities and states which are split by a comma
worksites = str_split(visa_df$WORKSITE, ",", simplify = TRUE)
head(worksites)

# grab the second column which is just the states
states = worksites[,2]
head(states)

# Now we can use the trimws() function to trim the whitespace and get rid of the leading spaces
states = trimws(states)
head(states)
# now add it to the dataframe
visa_df$states <- states
```

Next we notice that our Latitudes and Longitude columns are very specific, let's round these to make them easier on the eye.

```{r}
visa_df$lat = round(visa_df$lat,3)
visa_df$lon = round(visa_df$lon,3)
```


### Case Status Investigation
One of the key metrics of this dataset is the Case Status. Let's filter out the `NA` values in the dataset and plot this up. 

```{r,fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
# use the filter function from dplyr to filter the visa_df for all cases where CASE_STATUS is NOT NA (!is.na)
case_df = filter(.data = visa_df, !is.na(CASE_STATUS))
head(case_df)
# Now let's group the data by Case_status
case_df = group_by(.data = case_df, CASE_STATUS)
head(case_df)

# Now let's summarize the data based on total number of cases which would be the length of any variable within each sub-group. Here we choose the `lat` variable but it could be any variable here
case_df = summarise(.data = case_df, total_cases = length(lat))
head(case_df)

# plot it up!
ggplot(data = case_df, aes(x = reorder(CASE_STATUS,total_cases), y = total_cases/1000)) +  
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="coral", colour="dodgerblue4") + 
  labs(title="H1-B Visa Applications", x ="Case Status", y = "Number of applications (thousands)")
```

Something to notice with this `ggplot` instance is the `aes` edits for `x` and `y` arguments. Notice that we reorder the CASE_STATUS based on the `total_cases` metric. Also see that we divide teh `total_cases` by 1000 in order to make the graph more general.

Over 100,000 cases are Certified. Less than 5,000 cases are denied.

### Job Titles

What's the most common type of job for these visa requests? To find out, we'll have to look at the `JOB_TITLE` variable. Let's organize the data based on this variable

```{r}
# group the data based on the JOB_TITLE variable
job_df =  group_by(.data = visa_df, JOB_TITLE)
# summarize the data based on the total number of each JOB TITLE, here we aggregate the total number of latitude values for each JOB TITLE
job_df = summarise(.data = job_df, total_records = length(lat))
# trim our dataset down so that we only keep the top 50 JOB_TITLE values
job_df = top_n(x= job_df, n=50)
# arrange the data based on the total number of records (before this it was organized alphabetically)
job_df = arrange(.data = job_df, -total_records)

# print out the head of job_df
head(job_df)
```

Now, let's use ggplot2 to show us what the most popular job titles these visa's had.

```{r,fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
ggplot(data = job_df, aes(x = JOB_TITLE, y = total_records)) +  
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="aquamarine3", colour="black") +
  labs(title="", x ="Job title (top 50)", y = "Number of applications")
```

Hmm...that doesn't look great. What if we want to swap the X and Y axis? Simple! we just add in a `coord_flip()`

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
ggplot(data = job_df, aes(x = JOB_TITLE, y = total_records)) +  
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="aquamarine3", colour="black") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title="", x ="Job title (top 50)", y = "Number of applications")
```

Looks better, but how about we reorder it all based on the `total_records` column. Just use the `reorder` function!

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
ggplot(data = job_df, aes(x = reorder(JOB_TITLE,total_records), y = total_records)) +  
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="aquamarine3", colour="black") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title="2016 H1-B Visa Applications", x ="Job title (top 50)", y = "Number of applications")

```

The most frequent titles are BUSINESS ANALYST, PROGRAMMER ANALYST, and SYSTEMS ANALYST. 
  
## Recap

  - For loops are a popular coding practice and can be very useful. In R, for loops are designed to look like
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (numbers or values to loop over){
    condition where numbers/values is looping
}
```
  - `paste0()` is great for combining character strings and numbers together
  - R is great for big data (`visa_df` is ultimately 647,000 rows of data)
  - `dplyr` and `tibble` are once again great R packages for handling big data


## Visa 1 Assignment

1) List the top 10 states who apply for this H1-B Visa Application.

2) In the last example above, we examined the `JOB_TITLE` variable and discovered the most popular jobs. For this assignment, examine the most popular **employers**. In other words, create a `ggplot` instance of the top 50 repeat **employers** who apply for the H1-B Visa. Try and make it similar to the plot below


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
# group the data based on the JOB_TITLE variable
emp_df =  group_by(.data = visa_df, EMPLOYER_NAME)
# summarize the data based on the total number of each JOB TITLE, here we aggregate the total number of latitude values for each JOB TITLE
emp_df = summarise(.data = emp_df, total_records = length(lat))
# trim our dataset down so that we only keep the top 50 JOB_TITLE values
emp_df = top_n(x= emp_df, n=50)
# arrange the data based on the total number of records (before this it was organized alphabetically)
emp_df = arrange(.data = emp_df, -total_records)

ggplot(data = emp_df, aes(x = reorder(EMPLOYER_NAME,total_records), y = total_records)) +  
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="deepskyblue", colour="black") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title="2016 H1-B Visa Applications", x ="Employer Name (top 50)", y = "Number of Applications")

```
