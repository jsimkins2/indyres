# Introduction To R

Hello\! Welcome to Tech Trainings - From Excel to R. We’re here to
enhance the productivity of your business by ditching Excel and
employing R. Our tutorials are focused and designed for employees
currently working. R is currently ranked as the [7th most popular
language in the world](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) - and with good
reason\! We’ll dive into why R is ranked so high and how it can benefit
you and your business.

This intro to R course is designed to teach R to businesses and
employees who frequently use Excel for day-to-day operations. Few
businesses around the world leverage the amazing features of R and we’re
here to teach these skills. To put it bluntly, R saves you and your
employees a ton of time. We’ve seen users cut down daily 2-3 *hour*
tasks in Excel into 2-3 *minutes* after some basic introduction to R. In
this case, R saved this individual employee 750 hours per year -
allowing employee time to be used towards more creative problem-solving
endeavors.

This is a concentrated, fast-paced course designed to improve business
efficiency, cut down tedious tasks, and increase the creative time spent
by employees. Most online R tutorials are far too broad and can leave a
student frustrated at the vast abilities of R. R can be used to
accomplish a great deal, but instead of showing off what R can do, we
discuss and teach select skills that can be used to improve day-to-day
business efficiency immediately. We’re not here to waste your time and
overwhelm our students like other R workshops.

This concentrated course follows a design of specific problem solving.
We present common business practices often handled using Excel and show
an employee can use R to accomplish the same task at a faster pace. The
workshop is split into 5 days with assignments due each day. This course
was developed by James Simkins who has developed and taught multiple
programming courses at the University of Delaware.

## Agenda

This course is designed to be a 5 day course intended to provide
students with a strong foundation in R concepts and fundamentals. The
intended time per day is 2-3 hours.
