Reading data into R is a regular practice. R can ingest almost any type of file including CSV, Excel, Binary, XML, JSON, and many more. Today, we're going to read in a Microsoft Excel file into R. This file contains data on best-selling books from Amazon between 2009 and 2019. Before we begin, we will need to download the `amazon_bestsellers.xlxs` file from the course datasets folder. 

## Installing a Package

So far, we've only been using functions that are part of the `base` package and are automatically loaded into each session by RStudio. There are over 10,000 R packages available for download from R's package repository. All of these packages are free and contain pre-written functions for just about any computing purpose. Today, we're going to use the `readxl` package. This package helps us read Microsoft Excel files in R. Let's load in this package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

`Error in library(readxl) : there is no package called ‘readxl’`. This package is not currently installed. We can install the function now using the `install.packages()` function from the pre-loaded `base` package.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readxl")
```

You may need to select a **CRAN Mirror** before installing. CRAN stands for Comprehensive R Archive Network and it is a repository for R packages that is a replica of the primary R package database. You can select any of these mirrors, but it is recommended that you choose a mirror located in the United States if RStudio asks you to choose one.

**Only use the** `install.packages()` **function in the console**. Why? We only need to install a package once. After the package is installed, we will need to *load the package into each R session* but we will not need to install it again.  

After `readxl` is installed correctly, you'll see a message that looks like this;

`The downloaded binary packages are in /var/folders/6m/1b7gn_m93g9380p1jxvm2_700000gr/T//Rtmpcuw03I/downloaded_packages`

This is the location on your computer where the package and all it's functions are stored. We don't need to worry about the location as R handles this information for us. We also don't need to worry about packages taking up significant space on our hard drives. R packages are small in size. Now that `readxl` is installed, we can load it in via the `library()` function like we did above. This time, however, it should load in without any errors. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

Wonderful, now we can use functions from the `readxl` package. What happens if we try and use a function from `readxl` without first loading the package? R will not understand what you mean and return an error. We must always load in package with each R session and **before** we use a function in a script. This is why we load in packages that we need at the top of every R script - so they're run first. 

## Reading Data

We're ready to use the `readxl` package. What function can we use from this package to load in our dataset? Remember the `help()` function where we can find our more information on functions? We can use `??readxl` in the R console to find out more information on functions within this package. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??readxl
```

The `??` function runs a search on every function/package we have in R and looks for functions/packages containing `readxl`. Look for examples that begin with `readxl::`. This notation is used to inform us of packages and functions, i.e. `package::function`. Technically speaking, we *don't have to* load in a package if we use this notation...but it's a lot easier to just load in the package than to code every function as `package::function`. The notation of `package::function` is primarily used by certain software developers. For our purposes, loading in a package at the top of the script is perfectly acceptable and recommended. Remember, our goal is just to tell R where to find a function so we can use it.

Now that we have searched, we can see a line that reads as: `readxl::read_excel   Read xls and xlsx files`. We will use this function, `read_excel`, to read our `amazon_bestsellers.xlxs`. What arguments does the `read_excel`function take? We can use our `help()` function to find out.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(read_excel)
```

A shortcut for the `help` function is a single `?` and is used like so...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?read_excel
```

There are many arguments we can tinker with here if we needed to, but we only need to be concerned with the `path` argument that defines the "Path to the xls/xlsx file". 

## Paths

A path is a series of folder names that directs the computer to the location of a file. For example, if we download a file called `amazon_bestsellers.xlsx`, it is likely residing in our downloads folder. Our job is to find the path to that file. It *might* look like `/Users/your_name/Downloads/amazon_bestsellers.xlsx` on Mac or `C:\your_name\Downloads\amazon_bestsellers.xlsx`, but is there a way to check for it exactly? Let's introduce the `getwd()`, or get working directory, function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

My current directory (aka path) is `/Users/james`. This is where the "Home" direcoty is located in the files pane of our bottom right hand quadrant. Thus, in order for me to navigate to the Downloads folder, I simply need to type `"Downloads/amazon_bestsellers.xlsx"`. Additionally, if I wanted to, I could *change* the current path of the working directory with the `setwd()` function (aka set working directory).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("Downloads")
```

Now, if I use `getwd()` again...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

I find that my new working directory is `/Users/james/Downloads`. Thus, my full path to the `amazon_bestsellers.xlsx` file is `/Users/james/Downloads/amazon_bestsellers.xls`. 

### Path Navigation Trick

The `tab` key on our keyboard is a shortcut key for autocompletion. We can hit the `tab` key within a set of quotes `""` and a visualization of the files and folders of the current working directory will appear. From this point, we can actually click our way to a file and R Studio will automatically fill out the file path to the file for us. This keyboard shortcut can also be used to autocomplete functions, variables/objects, and packages. For example, if I have one really long variable name...

```{r}
onereaaaaaaalllllllyyyyylonnnngggggggvarrriabbblleeeeennnnaaammmeee = "use tab for a shortcut to this"
```

I can start typing the first few letters or so and click the `tab` key for an autocomplete menu to appear. If the top result is indeed what we want, we can hit the `tab` key *again* and the full name of the variable will autocomplete for us. This *can also be used* to list argument names within a function. The `tab` key is a great tool and can save us time and headache from mistyping paths or names.

### Reading in the File

Now that we have the path, we can finally use our `read_excel` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# open our amazon bestsellers file using read_excel from the readxl package
amzn = read_excel(path = "/Users/james/Downloads/amazon_bestsellers.xlsx")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
amzn = read_excel(path = "datasets/amazon_bestsellers.xlsx")
```

```{r}
class(amzn)
```
We read in our file succesfully but it was read in as a tibble dataframe by the `read_excel` function. This is a more advanced form of a dataframe that goes beyond the scope of this course. Let's convert it to just a standard data frame using our `data.frame()` function. 

```{r}
# overwrite our amzn tibble dataframe and convert it to a standard dataframe 
amzn = data.frame(amzn)
class(amzn)
```

Much better. Now let's print out the first few rows of the `amzn` dataframe using the `head()` function to get a feel for the dataset...

```{r}
head(amzn)
```

Here is a description of what this file contains.

| Variable Name | Definition |
|--------|--------|
| Name | Book Title |
| Author | Author of the Book | 
| User Rating  | Amazon book rating as of 10/13/2020 |
| Reviews | Total number of book reviews |
| Price | Book price as of 10/13/2020 |
| Year | Year it was in the top 50 bestsellers on Amazon |
| Genre | Book Genre |

We can actually sort the data by any of the variables we want using the `order()` function. Let's order the dataframe based on the User Rating.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
order(amzn$User Rating, decreasing=TRUE)
```

`Error: unexpected symbol in "order(amzn$User Rating"`. This is an example of how spaces are bad. R is unable to get around the space between User and Rating in thr variable name. Thus, we will need to rename this variable name to get rid of this.

```{r}
# use indexing to configure which column User Rating is. We know it is the 3rd column
amzn[,3]
# create new column named User_Rating that doesn't contain spaces and give it the values of the original User Rating variable name 
amzn['User_Rating'] = amzn[,3]

# print the first few lines of amzn
head(amzn)
```

Now we have a properly named `User_Rating` variable and we can delete the faulty variable name from earlier.

```{r}
# remove the 3rd column which is currently User Rating with a space
amzn[,3] = NULL
```

Using the code `amzn[,3] = NULL`, we effectively removed the 3rd column of the `amzn` dataframe. We need to be very careful **not to run this line again** as it will remove the 3rd column each time you run it. So, if we were to accidentally run this again, we would remove the `Reviews` variable within this dataframe which is not what we want to do. 

```{r}
# print the variable names of the amzn dataframe
names(amzn)
```

Now that our names have been fixed, we can look at an order of the highest rated books using the `order()` function on the `User_Rating` variable.

```{r}
# print the order of the user ratings
order(amzn$User_Rating, decreasing=TRUE)
```

This returns the the relative order of each book's rating (remember, each book has it's own **row**). As we can see, the 1st book has the 41st ranked rating. How can we actually re-order our dataframe so that we are sorted from the highest rated to the lowest rated?

```{r}
# reorder our rows based on the user rating column
amzn = amzn[order(amzn$User_Rating, decreasing=TRUE),]
```

In the line above, re-order each row for all columns **based** on the `User_Rating` column. We use our handy index brackets `[]` that take a `row` and `column` argument to sort each row based on the relative index order of the `User_Rating`. The `column` space (aka after the comma that is *outside* of the `order()` function) is left blank so we include *all* columns with this sorting measure. In short, this keeps each row set to the exact same but orders them based on their User Ratings.

```{r}
# print the top few rows
head(amzn)
```

```{r}
# print the last few rows
tail(amzn)
```

Our new column name 

## Plotting the Data

We use plotting as a data visualization method. Plotting the data is a way to tell a story about the data. R has some fantastic plotting packages such as `ggplot2`, `Lattice`, and `leaflet` that are covered in other courses. Today, let's introduce the R `base` plotting functions that offer basic, yet very customizable, visualizations. 

### Base Plotting

Base plotting in R comes with an ability to create scatter plots, bar plots, pie charts, histograms, line charts, etc. These are very customizable and offer a solid foundation when transitioning to more advanced plotting packages. While many programmers prefer plotting packages mentioned above, we can still use the `base` plotting functions from R to create aesthetically pleasing plots. When we are plotting, arguments become very important and these plotting functions can take many arguments. 

### Histograms

Histograms are visual representations of a spread of data. We can use these to quantify where the most frequent values are binned. Let's create a histogram of the User Ratings. 

```{r}
# histogram of the user rating vector from the amzn dataframe
hist(x = amzn$User_Rating)
```

The breaks, or bin width, of this histogram is pretty wide. Let's create finer break areas by listing each rating in a sequence function. 

```{r}
# histogram of the user rating from the amzn dataframe with breaks from 3.3 to 5 spaced by 0.1
hist(x = amzn$User_Rating, breaks = seq(from = 3.3, to= 5.0, by=0.1))
```

A user rating of 4.8 is the most popular rating for this best seller colleciton of books. From here, we can customize the title, color, x label, y label, etc. Unsure of which arguments you can set? Don't forget about the help function `?hist` . 

```{r}
# histogram of the user rating from the amzn dataframe with breaks from 3.3 to 5 spaced by 0.1
hist(x = amzn$User_Rating, breaks = seq(from = 3.3, to= 5.0, by=0.1),
     main = "Amazon Bestseller User Ratings", col = "lightblue", xlab = "User Ratings",
     ylab = "Number of Occurences")
```

From the help function we found out the that these arguments dictate the following parameters:

| Argument Name | Definition |
|--------|--------|
| `main` | Plot Title |
| `col` | Color of the histogram | 
| `xlab`  | X label name |
| `ylab` | Y label name |

Each plotting function *generally* follows the same argument naming scheme. However, they can vary, and this is why it's important to use the `help()` function for a plotting function. Additionally, a useful link to bookmark is the [R Color Naming Guide](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf). This contains the names of preloaded color names in R. This is where I found `lightblue`. 

### Pie Chart

Pie charts are useful plots when comparing the number of occurrences for categorical information. For example, one might use a pie chart for wins/losses of a sports team. One of the variables from the Amazon BestSellers dataset is Book Genre. Let's create a pie chart that shows a pie chart of the genres. First, we'll need to know which genres are part of the Amazon Book Genre dataset.

```{r}
# use the unique function to print the genres 
unique(amzn$Genre)
```

So there are only two broad genres within this dataset. Nonetheless, let's create a pie chart of these. Let's count the total number of occurrences for each genre. 

```{r}
# count the total number of occurrences for each genre.
fic = sum(amzn$Genre == 'Fiction')
nonfic = sum(amzn$Genre == 'Non Fiction')
```

Now, we can use these total numbers to create our piechart.

```{r}
# create a vector called slices that contain total number of fiction and nonfiction books
slices <- c(fic, nonfic)
# create a vector called lbls that contain labels for the respective total number of fiction and nonfiction books
lbls <- c("Fiction", "Non-Fiction")
# plot using the pie function
pie(x = slices, labels = lbls, main="Pie Chart of Amazon Bestseller Book Genres")
```

This is a good start. Let's customize this more by adding colors and percentage values.

```{r}
# create a pct vector that calculates the percentages of each value 
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct) # add percents to labels
lbls
```

Notice here we introduced the `paste` function that pasted the `pct` vector values to the end of the `lbls` values. The `paste` function and it's cousin, `paste0`, are very useful when dealing with character string combinations. This is a heavily used function for many developers. To expand or `lbls` further, we can add the `%` sign to the end of each value with the same `paste` function.

```{r}
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
lbls
```


```{r}
# create color vector that matches a color for each genre
cols = c("dodgerblue4", "seagreen1")
pie(x = slices,labels = lbls, col=cols,main="Pie Chart of Amazon Bestseller Book Genres")
```

### Scatter Plot

Another useful plot that can help describe a dataset is a scatter plot. Scatter plots are often used to evaluate a relationship between two variables. In our case, let's investigate the relationship between number of reviews and user rating. 

```{r}
# create scatterplot between number of reviews and user rating
plot(x = amzn$Reviews, y = amzn$User_Rating)
```


As we can see, there's not a distinct correlation between number of reviews and user rating. In other words, more reviews does not necessarily indicate a higher or lower user rating **for this dataset**. Remember, this dataset only contains the **Best Sellers**, so our data is limited to the best of the best. We'd likely see a different trend if we had all of the data available. Anyway, even plots that show us no correlation are useful. Let's spice this up a bit.


```{r}
# create scatterplot between number of reviews and user rating
plot(x = amzn$Reviews, y = amzn$User_Rating, xlab = "Total Reviews", ylab = "Average User Rating", main="Amazon Bestsellers 2009-2019")
```

We can actually go even further here and change our points using the `pch` argument which is short for plotting character. Then, we can adjust the background color of the points with the `bg` argument. To go even further, we can also change the size of the point with teh `cex` argument. 

```{r}
# create scatterplot between number of reviews and user rating
plot(x = amzn$Reviews, y = amzn$User_Rating, xlab = "Total Reviews", ylab = "Average User Rating", main="Amazon Bestsellers 2009-2019",
     pch = 23, bg = 'coral', cex = 2.0, col = "dodgerblue4")
```

With a few additional arguments, we're given the ability to customize any plot in R. Altogether, the script we created looks like this.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this script evaluates the Amazon Bestseller Books dataset
# James

### begin script ###

# load necessary packages
library(readxl)

# open our amazon bestsellers file using read_excel from the readxl package
amzn = read_excel(path = "/Users/james/Downloads/amazon_bestsellers.xlsx")



# DATA MANAGEMENT
# overwrite our amzn tibble dataframe and convert it to a standard dataframe 
amzn = data.frame(amzn)
# create new column named User_Rating that doesn't contain spaces and give it the values of the original User Rating variable name 
amzn['User_Rating'] = amzn[,3]
# remove the 3rd column which is currently User Rating with a space
amzn[,3] = NULL
# reorder our rows based on the user rating column
amzn = amzn[order(amzn$User_Rating, decreasing=TRUE),]


# HISTOGRAM PLOT
# histogram of the user rating from the amzn dataframe with breaks from 3.3 to 5 spaced by 0.1
hist(x = amzn$User_Rating, breaks = seq(from = 3.3, to= 5.0, by=0.1),
     main = "Amazon Bestseller User Ratings", col = "lightblue", xlab = "User Ratings",
     ylab = "Number of Occurences")


# PIE CHART PLOT
# count the total number of occurrences for each genre.
fic = sum(amzn$Genre == 'Fiction')
nonfic = sum(amzn$Genre == 'Non Fiction')
# create a vector called slices that contain total number of fiction and nonfiction books
slices <- c(fic, nonfic)
# create a vector called lbls that contain labels for the respective total number of fiction and nonfiction books
lbls <- c("Fiction", "Non-Fiction")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100) # create a pct vector that calculates the percentages of each value 
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct) # add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
cols = c("dodgerblue4", "seagreen1") # create color vector that matches a color for each genre
pie(x = slices,labels = lbls, col=cols,main="Pie Chart of Amazon Bestseller Book Genres")


# SCATTERPLOT
# create scatterplot between number of reviews and user rating
plot(x = amzn$Reviews, y = amzn$User_Rating, xlab = "Total Reviews", ylab = "Average User Rating", main="Amazon Bestsellers 2009-2019",
     pch = 23, bg = 'coral', cex = 2.0, col = "dodgerblue4")
```
```
